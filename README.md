# Computer Vision coursework

This project has been tested with Python 3.8 on Windows and 3.6 on Linux.

It requires the following packages:
* `opencv-contrib-python`
* `numpy`
* `scipy`

## Dataset

It uses the To The Bailey and Back (TTBB) dataset, which scripts expect to find at
`TTBB-durham-02-10-17-sub10` in the root directory, with a `left-images` directory
containing colour images and a `right-images` directory containing greyscale images.

These variables can found at the top of `main.py`. 

It can be run using `python main.py`.

## YOLO

This project uses You-Only-Look-Once, a state-of-art object detection system.

`yolo.py` expects to find COCO names, config, and YOLO weights in `yolo-coco`;
these variables can be found at the top of `yolo.py`.

### Outputs

Disparity maps are placed in `output/disparities`. Annotated images are placed in `output/images`.

Videos can be generated by running `video.py`; they are placed in `output/videos`.
